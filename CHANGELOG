# Changelog pre v1

## 0.4.0 (2022-06-25)

### Enhancements

* The behaviour have been cleaned up and the relationship between the behaviour and the API have been cleaned up.
* There is now a version atom in each HLL generated. This is not too important right now, but will be used in the future to block merging two HLL with incompatible versions (as an example if the hashing strategy changed)
